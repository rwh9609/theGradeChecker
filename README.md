# theGradeChecker

Sends me an e-mail via smtp if a grade has been updated on my school's portal website. 
The time period between the last day of class and the day grades were actually inputted 
was anywhere from 1 to ~21 days. I wanted to know how I did in some of my courses but 
was tired of the periodic check. so I made this script to do it for me and to send me 
an email if SOMETHING has changed on my grades page.
